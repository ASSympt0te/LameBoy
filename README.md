# LameBoy

LameBoy is a work-in-progress Game Boy emulator written in C#, with an original code base and design (albeit with a bit of inspiration from [bgb](http://bgb.bircd.org/)).

As it stands, it is not in a playable state, but we are quickly bringing it up to one (hopefully before the 200th commit).
