# LameBoy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ASSympt0te/LameBoy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ASSympt0te/LameBoy)

LameBoy is a work-in-progress Game Boy emulator written in C#, with an original code base and design (albeit with a bit of inspiration from [bgb](http://bgb.bircd.org/)).

As it stands, it is not in a playable state, but we are quickly bringing it up to one (hopefully before the 200th commit).

# Building

Windows - Copy lib/SDL2.dll to the bin directory, and run with VisualStudio 2015
